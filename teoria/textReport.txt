In this project we are analyzing data collected from 1976 to 2001 about airline fatal accidents by the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal , Canada (www.icao.int).
Our goal is to get a good prediction about future fatalitis through a bayesian approach.
Our data is structured with four columns, year, fatal, miles, rate.
"Passenger miles" are in units of 10^11 and the "accident rate" is the number of fatal accidents per 10^11 passenger miles.

---Table and descriptive plots---

I started with the simplest model i could immagine, that simply all the years look the same.
This means that the number of fatal accidents in each year are independend with a Poisson(/theta) distribution.
I set a non informative gamma prior distribution for /theta, that has (/alpha, /beta) = (0.01,0.01)

The model for the data is:

			$$y_i|/theta -> Poisson(/theta)$$ 

where /theta is the expected number of fatal accidents in an year.
If the prior distribution for /theta is (/gamma(/alpha,/beta)) then the posterior distrubution is  /gamma(/alpha+n/bar(y),/beta+n), where in this case n=26 and n/bar(y)= /sum^26_(i=1)y_i=634

## theoretical derivation of the predictive distribution

Let /tilde(y) be the number of fatal accidents in 2002. Given /theta, the predictive distribution for /tilde(y) is Poisson(/theta). 

$$p(y)=/frac{p(y|/theta)p(/theta)}{p(/theta|y)} 
	= /frac{Poisson(y|/theta) gamma(/theta|/alpha,/beta)}{gamma(/thata|/alpha+y,/beta+1)}
	= /frac{/gamma(/alpha+y)/beta^/alpha}{/gamma(/alpha)y!(1+/beta)^(/alpha+y)}
	= y /tilde Neg-bin(/alpha,/beta)$$

## post distro 

The posterior distribution for /theta is /theta|y /tilde Gamma(634,26) and the conditional distribution of /tilde(y) (the number of fatal accidents in  2002) is Poisson(/theta).

So to simulate values of /tilde(y) all we need to do is first generate a realized value form the posterior distribution of /theta as the mean. Iterating this process will generate values of  /tilde(y) from the posterior predictive distribution. What we are doing here is integrating numerically, using simulation, over the posterior distrobution in /theta.
We can simulate this easily in R.

We can specify the model in R using the package rJags.

The summary of the resulting object shows that the posterior mean and median of the /mu is about 24.37. This is also the posterior expectation of the predictive distribution for the numer of fatal accidents in 2002, represented by the node fatal[27].

The posterior predisctive distribution for the number of fatal accients in 2002 has median 24 and 95% posterior interval [15,35].

Recall that the posterior predictive distribution is a discrete distribution. We can compare this with the one simulated directly before.

# MODEL 2

Let m_i = number of passenger miles flown in year i and /lambda = accident rate per passenger mile.
The model for the data is $y_i|m_i, /lambda /tilde Poisson(m_i /lambda)$.
We use the noninformative /gamma(0,0) prior distribution for /lambda as we did for /mu previously.
The posterior distribution for /lambda is /lambda|y, m/tilde /gamma(nybar,nmbar) =  /gamma (643,275.56) where nmbar = /sum^26_{i=1}m_i:


##### DA ELIMINARE
Given /lambda, the predictive distribution for y2~002 is Poisson(/lambda m_2002) =
Poisson(2 x 10^12/lambda). The posterior predictive distribution for /tilde(y) will be (related to
the) negative binomial but the algebra is more complex due to the presence of
the 2  1012 scale factor based on the number of miles 
own. SO we let BUGS do
the hard work | you can see that the change to the BUGS code is rather minimal.
Note that we as before add an extra NA value to the vector of fatalities, and in
order to get a predictive distribution for this an anticipated value for the
number of miles 
own, in this case 20 (1011).
Also note that you cannot stick an expression in as an argument to a
distribution; an expression as fatal[i] dpois(lambda*miles[i]) will cause an
error.
